# labyrinth
Write a solution for the problem of finding a way out of the maze.  It is necessary to develop a module in accordance with all accepted development standards (coding to interfaces, tdd, solid, oop patterns) that would find a way out of the maze,  which can be represented by various types of maps (come up with your own options for the implementation of maps).  Develop at least two algorithms for finding a way out of the maze, each of which could work with all types of maps.  Find a use case for a database in a problem (PostgreSQL).  Conduct comprehensive automated testing of the module.  The program accepts a map, start point and end point as input.  As a result of the execution of the algorithm, an exit route from the maze should be obtained. Everything should be readable.
